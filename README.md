# RockbusterStealthLLC
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company transitioning to an online video rental service in order to stay competitive. Working with the business intelligence department, I will load all of Rockbusterâ€™s data into a relational database management system, use SQL to analyze the data, and answer any ad-hoc business questions that other departments may have.
